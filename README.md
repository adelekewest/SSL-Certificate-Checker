# SSL-Certificate-Checker
A simple script to check SSL certificates

This script uses the ssl module to get the SSL certificate for the specified URL and the OpenSSL module to parse the certificate. It then gets the expiration date of the certificate and converts it to a datetime object. Finally, it prints the expiration date in a formatted string.

To use the script, simply set the target URL and run the script. It will print the expiration date of the SSL certificate for the URL.
